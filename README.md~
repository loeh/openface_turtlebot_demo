# openface turtlebot demo
This is a modified version of the openface live web demo. Which can be found [here:](https://github.com/cmusatyalab/openface/tree/master/demos/web)
Instead of using the webcam of the client laptop, we use an webrtc stream which comes from our turtlebot. 
You need the actual openface dnn to use the demo. The easiest way is to get their docker container wich also includes all their demos found online.
